- To help others understand basic-to-advanced logic through clean and simple code examples

## 💡 What You'll Find

- ✅ Beginner-level problems and solutions
- ✅ Well-commented and easy-to-understand code
- ✅ Step-by-step improvement in logic and approach

## 🧠 Languages Practiced

- *C* – Core programming, file handling
